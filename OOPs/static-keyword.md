# static keyword :
-  static is a keyword that is used to define methods and properties that belong to the class itself, rather than to instances of the class.
- child class cannot access parent class property and function.

```
class User {
    constructor(username){
        this.username = username
    }

    logMe(){
        console.log(`Username: ${this.username}`);
    }

    static createId(){
        return `123`
    }
}

const hitesh = new User("hitesh")
// console.log(hitesh.createId())

class Teacher extends User {
    constructor(username, email){
        super(username)
        this.email = email
    }
}

const iphone = new Teacher("iphone", "i@phone.com")
console.log(iphone.createId()); // cannot access because of static keyword
```
